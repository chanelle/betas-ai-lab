🧪 Beta's AI Lab
================

### Experiments in Human-Centered AI, Creative Automation, & Neurodivergent Systems

⚡️ The Mission
--------------

I am an **AI Alchemist** exploring the intersection of large language models (Gemini, Perplexity) and real-world human needs.

This repository is a **living lab**. It contains prototypes, "messy" code, and functional demos that I am building in public. The goal isn't polished perfection—it's rapid iteration and transparency.

**Current Focus:**

*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash:** Multimodal interactions and long-context reasoning.
    
*   **Perplexity API:** Real-time information retrieval and synthesis.
    
*   **Neuro-inclusive UI:** Interfaces designed for focus and clarity.

I am building this to get **input**. I tried hiding it until it was perfect, but that's a lonely road.
